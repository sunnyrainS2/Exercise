##Background
  In this paper, authors focus on the two most popular modern smartphone operationg systems, Android and iOS.
  Here is the need-to-know information for this paper.

####1. User Interfaces on Mobile Devices
  Smartphone operating systems and browsers have minimalist user interfaces to make the size of mobile devices small.
  So their UI lack application identity indicators that are available in desktop OS and browsers.
  Only one mobile application can control the screen at a time, and mobile browsers display only one browser window at a time.
  
####2. Platform Security
  Mobile applications are less trusted than their desktop cuonterparts.
  Applications are isolated from each other by default.
  Google and Apple prevent users from installing malware by controlling how users install applications.
  
####3. Control Transfers

##Common Control Transfers
