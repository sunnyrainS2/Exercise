====
Bin Liu, Ramesh Govindan

## The contributions of this paper are:
> 1. Present the design and implementation of a scalable system for automatically detecting ad placement fraud in mobile apps.
> 2. Characterize the prevalence of ad placement fraud and how these frauds correlate with app raings, app categories, and other factors using a large collection of apps.



## Decaf Overview

## Optimizations for Coverage and Speed

## Evaluation
  An attack's plausibility is a combination of how prevalent the legitimate behavior is in real applications, and how accurately the attacker can copy the legitimate behavior. As the result of matching and evaluating each attack technique, of the 15 attacks, 8 mimic common legitimate behaviors and use highly accurate techniques.
  
 
## Characterizing Ad Fraud
  Here are some two solutions for the problems due to the absence of identity indicators.
  > 1. permanently dedicate some small portion of the screen to application identity.  
  > 2. support a trusted password entry mechanism.  
  > 3. stop using embedded login forms which exacerbate the problem of training users to ignore security indicators.
